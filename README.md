## Data Mapper
The Data Mapper project provides tooling to create, configure, and test data transformation in Apache Camel.  Highlights include:

* A visual editor for mapping between Java-based data models.  Mapping is simply a matter of dragging a field from the source model to the target model.
* The ability to generate Java-based models from XML Schema, XML instance documents, JSON schema, and JSON instance documents with automatic configuration of required data formats within Camel to handle marshalling to/from Java.
* OOTB support for mapping any combination of XML, Java, and JSON.  Users can further customize runtime configuration to support any-to-any transformation via Camel data formats.
* Runtime integration is based purely on Apache Camel and Dozer - no extra configuration files to keep track of!

## Getting Started
First off, you need to [install the tooling](https://github.com/fabric8io/data-mapper/wiki/Tooling-Installation).

Once that's done, you can choose your own adventure:
* [Learn the tooling with our example application](https://github.com/fabric8io/data-mapper/wiki/Example-Application-Walkthrough)
* [Add data transformation to an existing application](https://github.com/fabric8io/data-mapper/wiki/Adding-Transformation-to-an-Existing-Application)

## Providing Feedback
The [data-mapper forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/data-mapper) is the best place to ask questions, provide feedback, and engage with the Data Mapper community.
