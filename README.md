## Data Mapper
The Data Mapper project provides graphical tooling to assist in the creation, configuration, and testing of data transformation within Apache Camel including:

- A visual editor for mapping between source and target types.
- A specialized [Camel component](https://github.com/fabric8io/data-mapper/wiki/Transformation-Endpoints) that coordinates all steps required for data tranformation (marshalling, mapping, unmarshalling) as a single unit of work.
- OOTB support for mapping any combination of XML, Java, and JSON.  Users can further customize runtime configuration to support any-to-any transformation via Camel data formats.
- Source and target models can be generated from schema definitions or instance documents.
- Test support specific to data transformation.

## Getting Started
The Data Mapper project contains both tooling and runtime components.  In order to get started, you'll want to install both pieces into your enivornment:
* [Installing the Tooling](https://github.com/fabric8io/data-mapper/wiki/Tooling-Installation)
* [Building the Camel Component](https://github.com/fabric8io/data-mapper/wiki/Building-The-Project)

Once that's done, you can choose your own adventure:
* [Learn the tooling with our example application](https://github.com/fabric8io/data-mapper/wiki/Example-Application-Walkthrough)
* [Add data transformation to an existing application](https://github.com/fabric8io/data-mapper/wiki/Adding-Transformation-to-an-Existing-Application)

## Providing Feedback
